is located on the banks of the winding Liu River, roximately 255 km from Nanning, the regional capital. By road, it is about 167 km to Guilin, 167 km to Hechi, 237 km  to Nanning, 373 km to Fangchenggang, 448 km to Beihai. Swimming in the river is a tradition of the city. 
</p>
<p>
The river is normally green, but sometimes in summer, 
floods from the mountain areas upstream bring sediment which colors the water yellow. In early 2012,a cadmium spill upstream caused serious pollution worries. The river can be deep. Normally, 
the depth is 60–70 metres but can as deep as 90 metres before it floods over the wall. 
In 2000 a bus, with 78 passengers, fell over the side of a bridge, and into 27 metres of water.
